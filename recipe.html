<h2><br>Crepe Ingredeints:</h2>
<li>1 cup of oat flour (you can make this by blending rolled oats)</li>
<li>1 scoop of your favorite protein powder (vanilla or unflavored works well)</li>
<li>1 cup of Greek yogurt</li>
<li>1/2 cup of almond milk (or any milk of your choice)</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of honey or maple syrup (optional for sweetness)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
<li>Cooking spray or a small amount of oil for the pan</li>

<h2><br> for fillings:</h2>
<li>Greek yogurt</li>
<li>Fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, etc.)</li>
<li>Sliced bananas</li>
<li>Honey or maple syrup for drizzling (optional)</li>



<h2><br>Instructions:</h2>
<br><li>Prepare the Batter:
    In a blender, combine the oat flour, protein powder, Greek yogurt, almond milk, eggs, honey (if using), vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Blend until you have a smooth batter. If the batter is too thick, you can add a little more almond milk to achieve the desired consistency.</li>

<br><li>Let the Batter Rest:
    Allow the batter to rest for about 10-15 minutes. This helps the oat flour absorb the liquid and makes for a better texture in your crepes.</li>

<br><li>Cook the Crepes:
    Heat a non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Lightly grease it with cooking spray or a small amount of oil.
    Pour a small amount of batter (about 1/4 cup) into the pan and quickly swirl it around to spread it thinly and evenly.
    Cook for 1-2 minutes until the edges start to lift and the bottom is lightly golden.
    Flip the crepe and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side. Repeat this process for the remaining batter, adding a bit more oil to the pan as needed.</li>

<br><li>Assemble the Crepes:
    Spread Greek yogurt on each crepe.
    Add fresh berries and sliced bananas on top of the yogurt.
    Optionally, drizzle honey or maple syrup for extra sweetness.</li>

<br><li>Serve:
    Fold the crepes or roll them up, and serve immediately while they're warm.</li>

<br><h3><b>These high-protein crepes are not only delicious but also provide a good dose of protein from the Greek yogurt and protein powder. Plus, they're versatile, so you can customize the filling to your liking with different fruits and toppings. Enjoy!</b></h3>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<div style="position: relative;">
    <img src="images/grilled-salmon-fillet-with-lemon-white-platter-horizontal-view-from_268847-3524.jpg" alt="Alt Text" style="position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; width: 300px; height: auto;">
  </div>

<li>4 salmon fillets (6-8 ounces each)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>Lemon wedges for garnish</li>
<li>Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>

<h3>Prepare the Marinade:</h3>
    
<li> 1. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, minced garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, dried oregano, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. This will be your marinade.</li>

<h3>Marinate the Salmon:</h3>

   <li> 2. Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish or a large resealable plastic bag.
  <li> 3.  Pour the marinade over the salmon fillets, ensuring they are well coated.
   <li> 4. Seal the bag or cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. You can marinate for longer if you have the time, up to 2 hours.</li>

    <h3>Preheat the Grill:</h3>

   <li> 5. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (about 400-450°F or 200-230°C). Make sure to clean and oil the grill grates to prevent sticking.</li>

   <h3>Grill the Salmon:</h3>

    <li> 6. Remove the salmon from the marinade and let any excess drip off.
    <li>7. Place the salmon fillets skin-side down on the grill.
    <li>8. Grill for about 4-6 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fillets. You want the salmon to be opaque and easily flake with a fork. Be careful not to overcook, as salmon can dry out quickly.</li>

    <h3>Serve:</h3>

    <li> 9. Carefully remove the grilled salmon from the grill using a spatula. You can leave the skin on the grill if it sticks.
    <li> 10. Transfer the grilled salmon fillets to a serving platter.
    <li> 11. Garnish with lemon wedges and fresh parsley, if desired.</li>

<h3><b>Serve the grilled salmon hot with your choice of side dishes, such as steamed vegetables, rice, or a salad.
    This grilled salmon recipe is not only high in protein but also packed with flavor from the marinade. It's a healthy and delicious meal that's perfect for lunch or dinner. Enjoy!</b></h3><br><br><br><br><hr>

  </div>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<li>1 block of extra-firm tofu, cubed</li>
<br>
<li>2 cups broccoli florets</li>
<br>
<li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
<br>
<li>1 yellow bell pepper, sliced</li>
<br>
<li>1 small onion, thinly sliced</li>
<br>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<br>
<li>1 tablespoon ginger, minced</li>
<br>
<li>1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
<br>
<li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
<br>

<br>
<li>2 tablespoons water</li>
<br>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil for stir-frying</li>
<br>
<li>Cooked brown rice or quinoa for serving</li>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<li>Press the tofu: Place the tofu between two clean kitchen towels and place a heavy object on top (like a cast iron pan). Let it press for about 15-20 minutes to remove excess water. Then, cut the tofu into cubes.</li>
<br>
<li>In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, honey or agave nectar, cornstarch, and water to make the sauce. Set it aside.</li>
<br>
<li>Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
<br>
<li>Add the tofu cubes to the skillet and stir-fry until they turn golden brown on all sides. Remove the tofu from the skillet and set it aside.</li>
<br>
<li>In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and ginger. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
<br>
<li>Add the sliced onion, broccoli florets, and bell peppers to the skillet. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until the vegetables begin to soften but are still crisp.</li>
<br>
<li>Return the cooked tofu to the skillet with the vegetables.</li>
<br>
<li>Pour the sauce over the tofu and vegetables. Stir-fry for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce thickens and coats everything evenly.</li>
<br>
<li>Serve the stir-fry over cooked brown rice or quinoa.</li>
